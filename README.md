# My Neovim Config

I'm Adam, work mainly in web development so and this is my neovim config. I work mainly in PHP and Javascript projects, using frameworks like Laravel, Vue and Magento. Here's a few things that are special about this config. 

- Configured support for blade file treesitter parsers (for Laravel projects) 
- Better handling for long js files (editor stays fast no matter what)
